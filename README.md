Tetris Application
=============

This is the finished tetris application after leading a group of 6 students that made up a cohort in a larger division of 18 students.
As a group we fixed many of the bugs in the original code and also implemented many different features. 
Some of the implemented features are:
- Brick movement only responding to user-input
- Scoring system
- Leveling system
- Bricks changing color to indicate level change and brick fall speed increase
- On-screen notifications when rows are cleared and points are earned
